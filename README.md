# configs

A version controlled backup of dotfiles for bash & zsh terminal setups.

All of this code is open-source, with a good chunk borrowed and modified from my good friend [@Coopster80](https://www.github.com/Coopster80), and the `tmux` config modified off of [this one](https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config/tree/master). Feel free to pillage, plunder, and copy to your hearts content.
